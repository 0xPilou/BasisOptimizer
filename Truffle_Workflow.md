# TRUFFLE WORKFLOW

Truffle is a Framework for developing smart contract

## Folder Architecture : 

contracts -> smart contracts Solidity files
migration -> migration files (defines how to deploy the contracts on the network)
test -> solidity or js test scripts
build -> json files that represent the compiled contracts

## How-To :

0 - Initialize truffle projet (truffle init)

1 - Write smart contract 

2 - Write migration file 

3 - Compile contract (truffle compile)

4 - Start local test net (truffle develop)

5 - Run the migration in the CLI (migrate)

6 - Interact with the smart contract using the CLI (call contract name)
